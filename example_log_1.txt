This will bring up their mini-profile menu, where you can find the tipping option represented by a shiny gold coin on the far right. Alternatively, you can hit the '+' symbol in a direct message and choose the 'Tip Gold' option. Slide to select how much you want to tip in gold bars, ranging from 1G to 10,000G. If you don't have gold bars handy, you can convert your regular gold right in the tipping system. Just keep in mind that there is a conversion tax - for example, a 500G tip will actually cost you 550G. | metadata: {'message_type': 'system_response', 'completed': True, 'supporting_urls': ['https://support.highrise.game/en/articles/8043190-what-are-tip-jars', 'https://support.highrise.game/en/articles/8043185-how-does-tipping-work']}
